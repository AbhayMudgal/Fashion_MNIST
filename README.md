# Fashion_MINST
Image Classification is a critical subcomponent in many CV systems. There are various techinques by which Machines can classify images but CNNs remain by far the best systems that are used for the task. The Fashion-MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images (and 10,000 test images) of fashion and clothing items, taken from 10 classes. Each image is a standardized 28Ã—28 size in grayscale (784 total pixels). Fashion-MNIST was created by Zalando as a compatible replacement for the original MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The dataset is readily available as csv on multiple platforms and is one of the most basic datasets to get started with Computer Vision.
